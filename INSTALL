To compile lalibe, you must specify where chroma is with the following directive:

-DCHROMA_INSTALL=<chroma installation path>

For now, chroma is a dependency of lalibe, although this may change in the future.
Here is a sample script below for compiling lalibe (assuming the source code is in a folder called src and chroma is compiled in a folder named install).

#!/bin/bash
#
#################
# BUILD LALIBE
#################

INSTALLDIR=install
SRCDIR=src

mkdir  ./build_lalibe
cd ./build_lalibe

export CC=`which mpicc`
export CXX=`which mpicxx`

CHROMA_DIR=${INSTALLDIR}/chroma
cmake -DCHROMA_INSTALL=${CHROMA_DIR} -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALLDIR}/lalibe ${SRCDIR}/lalibe

make
make install

popd
